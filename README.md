# gtrendsR_Daily_Long_History
Use gtrendsR to obtain Google Trends Data on a daily granularity for a period longer than 90 days

## Details
This R script is using the gtrendsR package to retrieve daily google trends interest over time data for selected keywords, regions, country and channel, for periods over 90 days. Google trends doesn't allow daily level data for calls with period longer than 90 days and this short script is the quick solution I came up with. 

## Author's note
It's not a production level code but for the purposes of getting the data needed and testing the model before production is good.
